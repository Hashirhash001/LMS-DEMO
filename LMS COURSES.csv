Organizations handle various types of information from public marketing materials to highly confidential trade secrets. Proper classification ensures that appropriate security measures are applied to each type of data. The most common classification levels are Public Internal Confidential and Restricted. Public information can be shared freely with anyone. Internal information is for organizational use only. Confidential information requires special handling and access controls. Restricted information demands the highest level of protection with strict access limitations.,Video,15,1,Learn data classification levels and security principles,https://www.youtube.com/embed/kcckpWgkhP0,"What are the four common data classification levels?|Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted|Public and Private Only|Internal and External|Secure and Insecure~Why is data classification important for security?|It helps apply appropriate security measures to different types of information|It increases storage capacity|It reduces network bandwidth|It prevents all cyber attacks~Which classification level requires the highest protection?|Restricted|Confidential|Internal|Public~What should be done with Public data?|It can be shared freely with anyone|It should be locked away|It requires encryption|It needs approval for access~Which classification requires special handling and access controls?|Confidential|Public|Restricted|Internal"
